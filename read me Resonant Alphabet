## Abstract
We present a deterministic mapping that links orthographic symbols (A–Z), acoustic frequency, and chromatic hue through a single normalized variable \( v \in [-1, 1] \). The pipeline
is strictly monotonic and therefore bijective; its derivative is positive everywhere, which guarantees differentiability and invertibility across the domain. We validate the mapping empirically
using three datasets (letters→audio, color→audio, and a continuous inverse sweep) and report metrics suitable for continuous integration checks (monotonicity, positivity of \(df/dv\),
and correlation structure). The result is a practical backbone for “resonant glyphs”—geometric figures (e.g., Lissajous patterns) generated from text via frequency interference.

## 1. Introduction
Cross‑modal correspondences—sound, color, and geometry—can be formalized without mysticism by enforcing a single control variable \(v\) that governs all domains.
When each stage is strictly monotonic, the map is bijective and invertible; when the derivative is positive everywhere, the composition remains differentiable.
This paper specifies such a mapping, demonstrates empirical validation, and outlines applications to glyph synthesis and visual music.

## 2. Methods

### 2.1 Normalization
Letters A–Z are indexed \( i \in \{0,\dots,25\} \) and mapped to a signed unit interval
\[
v(i) = \frac{i - 12.5}{12.5} \in [-1, 1].
\]
Other domains (numbers, shapes, y‑position) are affinely scaled to the same interval. Color is parameterized via a proxy from hue→wavelength, then scaled to \(v\).

### 2.2 Frequency Mapping (Log‑Hz Semitone Law)
Given a root \( f_0 \) (Hz) and a symmetric range of \( R \) semitones, pitch is
\[
f(v) = f_0 \cdot 2^{(R/12)\,v}, \qquad v \in [-1,1].
\]
This mapping is strictly increasing; its inverse is
\[
v(f) = \frac{12}{R}\log_2\!\left(\frac{f}{f_0}\right).
\]

### 2.3 Differentiability
The derivative exists and is positive for all \(v\):
\[
\frac{df}{dv} = f_0 \cdot 2^{(R/12)\,v} \cdot \frac{R\ln 2}{12} > 0.
\]
Hence \(f\) is \(C^\infty\) on \([-1,1]\) and invertible.

### 2.4 Datasets
We validate with three CSVs (see Data Availability):
1. **Letters→Audio**: letter, index, \(v\), \(\Delta\) semitones, \(f\) (Hz), MIDI, label.  
2. **Color→Audio**: hue→wavelength→\(v\) and resulting \(f\) (Hz).  
3. **Inverse Sweep**: 25 evenly‑spaced \(v\) across \([-1,1]\) with corresponding audio and color values.

### 2.5 Visual Geometry
Let \(R_L, R_R\) be small integer harmonic sets and \(e(t)\) an amplitude envelope. The stereo Lissajous system is
\[
\begin{aligned}
x(t) &= \sum_i e(t-t_i) \sum_{k \in R_L} a_k \sin(2\pi k f_i t + \phi_{i,k}), \\
y(t) &= \sum_i e(t-t_i) \sum_{k \in R_R} b_k \sin(2\pi k f_i t + \psi_{i,k}).
\end{aligned}
\]
Closed forms and rosettes arise from small‑integer relations between left/right composites.

## 3. Results

### 3.1 Monotonicity and Bijection
For the 26‑letter set, \( f(v) \) is strictly increasing; no duplicate \(v\) or \(f\) occurs. This implies one‑to‑one mapping.

### 3.2 Differentiability and Slope
Numerically, the discrete derivative \( \Delta f / \Delta v \) remains positive for all samples and matches the analytic form above. Mean and variance are stable across the alphabet.

### 3.3 Cross‑Modal Correlations
Color‑derived \(v\) correlates strongly with audio frequency; \(\Delta\) semitones is exactly linear in \(v\) by construction. Empirical correlations serve as regression guards in CI.

## 4. Discussion
A single, smooth, invertible pipeline \( \text{symbol} \to v \to f \to \{\text{hue}, \text{geometry}\} \) yields reproducible sonic and visual structures.
This alignment supports applications in visual music, glyph synthesis, data sonification, and joint embeddings of text/audio/shape.
Future work includes 3D solids of revolution from Lissajous rotors and mode analysis via finite‑element methods.

## 5. Reproducibility Checklist
- Deterministic CSV inputs under `./data/`  
- Verification script `verify_mapping.py` (runs in CI)  
- Thresholds: strictly monotone; all discrete derivatives \(>0\); correlation(v, frequency) ≥ 0.98; correlation(v, Δsemitones) = 1.0 (color set)
